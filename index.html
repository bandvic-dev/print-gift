          Happy Birthday Jean-Luc!
          <br />
          <br />
          You are a very special person who likes to kick toads and hunt nazis.
          Your middle-weight belt was hard-earned as was your Nobel peace prize.
          We hope you enjoy reading about insects and werewolves. Have an
          ice-cream if you feel like it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Love Georgia
